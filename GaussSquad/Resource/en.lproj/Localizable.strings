"VLinearEquationsBar_labelDescr"="A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable (however, different variables may occur in different terms).\n\nGauss was a German mathematician sometimes referred to as the Princeps mathematicorum (the foremost of mathematicians).\n\nGaussian elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to find the rank of a matrix, to calculate the determinant of a matrix, and to calculate the inverse of an invertible square matrix";
